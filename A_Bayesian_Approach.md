# A Bayesian Approach to assess NSW sea garfish

## Method

The parameter of the best model, model 2, are estimated using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) using the R package BayesianTools.

## Results

The traces of the MCMC show that the MCMC converged very quickly

The posterior distributions of the parameters is unimodal and symetric. They were compared to Guaussian distributions with the same mean and standard distributions: the empirical and theoretical distributions are in good agreement.
